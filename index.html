        <h3> Our History </h3>
    </header>
    Durham House of Pets was founded by Hannah in 1985. When the company first opened, it was selling what many expect to find at a petstore. Now we sell items that differentiate us as a company, like our water and food bowls that alert the owner via text message that they need to be refilled. Over the past 33 years, we have became more than just your average pet store. We are a one of a kind experience with our customizable products and excellent customer service.
